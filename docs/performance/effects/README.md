# Native effects baseline

[effects_bench.rs](../../../crates/zgui-gpu/examples/effects_bench.rs) runs native offscreen GPU workloads. [amd-vulkan.jsonl](amd-vulkan.jsonl) contains the complete results recorded on 2026-10-03: AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics, Vulkan, AMD proprietary driver, release build, 1280×720 at scale 1, 30 warmup frames and 240 measured frames per case. GPU timestamps were supported and no profiles were dropped.

Four translucent panels overlap the same patterned backdrop. Each panel covers approximately 486×346 physical pixels. `overlap` changes backdrop opacity; `scroll` translates clipped scroll content; `foreground` blinks a cursor painted after the filters; `resize` resizes the target and panel geometry. Separate cases animate typed uniforms, resize shader textures, update eight dither surfaces, and animate the dither suffix of a static `blur → dither` chain.

GPU values below are p50 / p95 / p99 milliseconds, measured from native timestamp queries. Both blur algorithms use the same nominal sigma; their kernels produce different images. Ratios compare medians for this scene and device.

| Workload | Sigma | Gaussian GPU ms | Dual Kawase GPU ms | Median speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Overlapping panels | 6 | 2.256 / 2.363 / 4.948 | 1.309 / 3.317 / 4.645 | 1.72× |
| Overlapping panels | 24 | 6.537 / 6.726 / 13.524 | 1.379 / 3.620 / 3.919 | 4.74× |
| Scrolling beneath panels | 24 | 6.483 / 6.697 / 13.399 | 1.323 / 3.439 / 3.713 | 4.90× |
| Target and panel resize | 24 | 6.363 / 6.496 / 13.202 | 1.323 / 3.515 / 3.826 | 4.81× |
| Foreground cursor, cached source | 24 | 0.355 / 0.368 / 0.381 | 0.346 / 0.356 / 0.363 | 1.03× |

Kawase encodes more passes: overlap sigma 24 used 0.734 ms median CPU encode/submit versus Gaussian's 0.302 ms. Completed-frame medians, including the benchmark's explicit GPU wait, were 2.271 versus 6.982 ms. At sigma 6, Kawase's median improved but its p95 was higher; these measurements do not justify a universal speedup claim or an automatic quality cutoff.

Cached foreground frames filtered zero pixels, with four blur cache hits per frame and a cheap composite for either backend. Recomputed overlap frames filtered 675,328 output pixels per frame. Gaussian retained 9 MiB of blur textures; Kawase retained 6 MiB plus approximately 0.50 MiB of shared pyramid scratch. These counts exclude render targets and driver allocations.

One animated shader surface cost 0.169 ms median GPU time; eight dither surfaces cost 0.699 ms. Both allocated zero shader resources after warmup. Shader resize allocated one resource bundle per frame. The animated chain cost 0.182 ms, reused its blur stage every frame, and dispatched only its dither stage, with zero resource allocations. The runner asserts these cache and allocation invariants.

Run from the zgui workspace:

```powershell
$env:ZGUI_BENCH_OUTPUT = 'effects-results.jsonl'
cargo run --release -p zgui-gpu --features benchmark --example effects_bench
```

The runner appends JSONL records. Use a fresh output path for each baseline. `ZGUI_BENCH_FRAMES`, `ZGUI_BENCH_WARMUP`, `ZGUI_BENCH_ONLY` (substring filter), `ZGUI_BENCH_SIZES` (e.g. `1280x720,1920x1080`), `ZGUI_BENCH_SIGMAS` (e.g. `6,24`), `ZGUI_BENCH_HZ`, `ZGUI_BENCH_IN_FLIGHT`, and `ZGUI_BENCH_TRACE` configure sampling and an optional Perfetto CPU trace. Default in-flight count is one; waits and profiling belong to the benchmark, not production scheduling. No image readback is included in timed frames.

The JSON records contain CPU stage distributions, per-label GPU distributions, filtered output pixels, allocation counters, and retained memory. GPU `total` is the interval between the first and last timestamp, including gaps between passes. Each per-label value sums that label's spans within a frame. Shader-resource and effect-chain memory include final textures also counted in image memory; do not sum those overlapping fields. This is one unpaced run on a shared desktop, so inspect tails and rerun on target hardware before choosing budgets.

## Animated subtree workload — 2026-10-04

[Raw results](transition-amd-vulkan-20261004.jsonl) measure four overlapping frosted
panels scaling and rotating over a scrolling background, with four retained dither
surfaces updated once per three UI steps. Logical phase advances at 60 steps/sec;
the benchmark itself runs unpaced. Same AMD integrated Radeon/Vulkan backend,
release build, 1280×720, 30 warmup and 120 measured frames, one frame in flight.
This uses the production renderer offscreen; native presentation is excluded.

Completed-frame values include update, flush, encode/submit and explicit GPU wait:

| Backend | Sigma | Median ms | p95 ms | p99 ms | CPU encode/submit median ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Gaussian | 6 | 3.768 | 8.196 | 10.197 | 0.852 |
| DualKawase | 6 | 4.027 | 8.489 | 9.852 | 1.528 |
| Gaussian | 24 | 8.693 | 13.378 | 15.023 | 1.113 |
| DualKawase | 24 | 6.116 | 11.471 | 17.916 | 2.255 |

At sigma 24, Kawase reduced the completed-frame median by about 30% in this
single run. Its p99 was higher. At sigma 6 Gaussian had the lower completed-frame
median. The extra Kawase passes increase CPU encoding cost; keep the backend
explicitly swappable and use measured quality/performance on target hardware.

All four cases allocated zero shader-resource bundles, geometry buffers, vertex
buffers and layer textures after warmup. Each dispatched 160 shader updates over
120 frames (four surfaces every third step). Blur crops grew twice per case;
resizing filter footprints therefore still occasionally allocates textures.
Retained paint geometry was 4,160 bytes, images 737,280 bytes, blur cache
8,257,536 bytes, and vertices 65,536 bytes. Gaussian scratch was 1,032,192 bytes;
Kawase scratch was 681,408 bytes at sigma 6 and 687,708 bytes at sigma 24.

GPU timestamps and stage distributions are preserved in the raw records.
The availability/count checks passed, but GPU total timestamp tails exceed
completed CPU-frame bounds in this run; do not interpret those totals as pure
GPU work or derive new GPU speedup claims from them without checking their
clock/span behavior. The comparison above uses the explicit completed-frame wait.

Reproduce with a fresh output path:

```powershell
$env:ZGUI_BENCH_ONLY = 'transition'
$env:ZGUI_BENCH_FRAMES = '120'
$env:ZGUI_BENCH_WARMUP = '30'
$env:ZGUI_BENCH_SIZES = '1280x720'
$env:ZGUI_BENCH_SIGMAS = '6,24'
$env:ZGUI_BENCH_OUTPUT = 'transition-results.jsonl'
cargo run --release -p zgui-gpu --features benchmark --example effects_bench
```
