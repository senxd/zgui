# Latest Linux comparison rerun — preregistered 2026-09-26

Revision: `ca22316ec63f3605204eecfc2cee1cfeffac5c9a` (latest main fetched by the parent before this run).

Fresh release builds of zgui public component workload, GPUI0.2.2, and QuickGUI811d6e2816d5229711f59683c4c9dfbb6fc74133. All three adapters receive release verification builds from this revision; no prior frozen binary is reused. Every source file used by the patched `vendor/wgpu-hal` crate is hashed and archived. No old performance data substitutes for this measurement.

36 trials: idle, streaming, scrolling, combined; each framework three times; rotated framework order. Each requests20 seconds, excludes the first5 seconds from process CPU/RSS sampling, and samples every50ms. Common private Xvfb/Openbox and Mesa software Vulkan with LP_NUM_THREADS=4 per Mesa pool. Same private loader for all frameworks. No repository builds during measurement; periodic host process observations record unrelated activity. No CPU affinity or thermal isolation.

Gate: every active trial delivers58–61 logical updates per requested second; idle reports0. This checks model updates, not presented frames. Failed trials and raw evidence remain; no silent retry, omission or changed gate. Failed series prohibits equivalent-work speed claims; any retry must use a separate directory with explicit reason.

All adapters use the shared100,000-row virtualized workload (28px rows,400px viewport,2-row overscan), bounded streaming text, common geometry/font/colors. Capture all interfaces at seeded180ticks outside measurements. The shared workload also contains separate animation/busy modules. Those additional workloads are outside this preregistered comparison; all freshly built adapters link the same current shared source.

Report all repeats, medians/ranges. CPU is percent of one logical core; RSS is resident process MiB, not GPU/other-process memory. Software-renderer Linux results cannot establish hardware GPU/macOS/universal framework rankings. QuickGUI may create multiple Mesa pools despite the same per-pool worker setting.
